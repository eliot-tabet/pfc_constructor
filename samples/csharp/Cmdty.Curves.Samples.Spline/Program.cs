            // This assumption is fine for instruments where the commodity is delivered at a constant rate, e.g. natural gas forwards.
            // An alternative weighting scheme can be added by calling WithAverageWeighting and supplying a weighting scheme as a function.
            // The below example makes use of the Weighting helper class to provide the weighting function as the count of business days.
            // An example of when such a weighting scheme should be used is for oil swaps, based on an index which is only published on a business day
            // to create a monthly curve from quarterly granularity inputs.
